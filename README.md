## What is this?

The official public-library OPAC (AbsysNET) is great if you already know the title you want. biblioHack flips it around: it keeps a **local, searchable mirror** of the catalogue so you can explore it the way you'd browse a bookshop — search in natural Spanish (accents optional), filter to the literary catalogue, see **which branch has a copy on the shelf right now**, and (on the roadmap) get **recommendations based on what you've already read**.

It's also a study in doing this **politely and sustainably**: a rate-limited crawler that's a good citizen of a public system, a history-preserving availability time-series, and a clean hexagonal codebase.

### What works today

- 🔎 **Full-text search in Spanish** — accent-insensitive (`café` finds `cafe`) via Postgres `spanish_unaccent` + a generated `tsvector`.
- 📖 **Literary-first catalogue** — records are classified by audience (adult / youth / children) and literary form (literary / non-fiction) from shelf-mark and CDU signals. The default scope shows the **adult literary catalogue**; a toggle includes children's, youth and non-fiction. Nothing is discarded — just scoped.
- 🟢 **Live availability by branch** — a history-preserving time-series of copies per branch, surfaced as "*N disponibles ahora*" badges.
- 🖼️ **Book covers** — resolved asynchronously (Open Library → Google Books → placeholder) and served from a content-addressed store, off the crawl path.
- 🤖 **Autonomous, resumable crawler** — a containerised, scheduled crawler walks the catalogue with a persisted cursor, growing the mirror hour by hour without ever re-scanning from the top.
- 📊 **Production APM** — OpenTelemetry tracing (FastAPI + asyncpg) exported to Grafana Tempo / SigNoz.

### On the roadmap

- 🧠 **Semantic search & recommender** — BGE-M3 embeddings in pgvector, "more like this" and history-based suggestions.
- 📥 **Reading-history import** (Goodreads) to seed the recommender.
- 🗺️ **Expansion** beyond Huelva to other Andalusian provinces.

## How it works

biblioHack is a **hexagonal (ports & adapters) modular monolith**. The domain logic never imports a framework or a driver; adapters (the AbsysNET scraper, Postgres repositories, the cover providers) plug in behind Protocol ports, which keeps the core testable and the deployment topology a free choice.

```

- **Read + serve plane** is public (read-only) behind the tunnel; **write/admin, the database and the crawler are never exposed** to the internet.
- The **crawler runs separately** from the API so a heavy headless-browser workload can't affect request latency. It paginates the OPAC's expert-query results with a **resumable offset cursor**, so it advances through the whole catalogue across runs and then tracks new arrivals.
- **Availability is a time-series**: copies are upserted (never delete+insert) so each re-scrape appends a snapshot rather than wiping history.

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design, the scrape state machine, and the data model.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** and [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Node 20+** and [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/)
- **Docker** + **Docker Compose**
- **make** (optional, for the convenience targets)

### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jarcos/biblioHack.git
cd biblioHack
cp .env.example .env

# 1. Bring up postgres + redis + api + frontend
make dev-up

# 2. Backend checks (ruff + mypy + pytest)
make backend-check

# 3. Frontend checks (eslint + astro check + vitest)
make frontend-check

# 4. Open the apps
open http://localhost:8800/docs   # FastAPI Swagger
open http://localhost:4321        # Astro frontend
```

Every `make` target is a one-liner — peek inside the [`Makefile`](./Makefile) if you'd rather run things directly. Scraping is opt-in (it's a heavy, browser-backed dependency set): `cd backend && uv sync --extra scraper && uv run camoufox fetch` then `uv run bibliohack catalog --help`.

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed. Sensible defaults are provided for local development; the OpenTelemetry exporter and other production settings stay dormant unless their env vars are set.

## Observability

The production `api` is instrumented with **OpenTelemetry** (APM / distributed tracing). The container runtime wraps `uvicorn` with `opentelemetry-instrument`, which auto-instruments **FastAPI** and **asyncpg** — HTTP requests and DB queries become spans with no application-code changes. It is a **no-op locally**: instrumentation only activates when the `OTEL_*` env vars are set (defined only in `docker-compose.prod.yml`), so dev runs and tests are unaffected.

In production, telemetry is exported via **OTLP** to a shared OpenTelemetry collector, which fans traces out to **Grafana Tempo** and **SigNoz** (`service.name=bibliohack-api`). See [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §10](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

---

## Deployment

Green pushes to `main` are gated by CI (lint, typecheck, tests, image build) and then **auto-deploy** to a Synology NAS over Tailscale. The public surface is served through a Cloudflare Tunnel (read-only; no inbound ports). Database migrations ship in the API image and run on deploy. The crawl plane runs as a separate, self-restarting container so it can't affect the public site. Details — including the hard-won Synology specifics — live in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §10](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal project, but issues, ideas and PRs are welcome. If you're contributing code:

1. Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the conventions (it's written for AI assistants but applies to humans too).
2. Before pushing, the backend must pass `ruff format --check .`, `ruff check .`, `mypy src`, and `pytest`; the frontend must pass its lint/typecheck/test — all enforced in CI.
3. Add an Alembic migration for any schema change.
4. **Be a good OPAC citizen.** The crawler is deliberately rate-limited and capped because it talks to a live public-library system. Please don't change it to be more aggressive.

---

## Responsible use & data

biblioHack mirrors **public-sector bibliographic data** that belongs to the Junta de Andalucía and the Spanish public-library system, reused under the [Spanish public-sector information rules (Ley 37/2007)](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2007-19814). The crawler identifies itself, throttles every request, and caps its volume so it never burdens the source system. This project is independent and unaffiliated.
